  <p>
    There used to be a snazzy list of links here.
    Then I realised that half of the links don't and will never work.
    So here's a more bare-bones links page linking to stuff
    that does work well here,
    Though if you peek around you might find some more stuff
    other than the things linked here,
    but there's no guarantee of quality there.

  <ul class="linkset">
    <li><a href="Languages/language-list.html">
        A list of languages that I have made.
    </a></li>
    <li><a href="Pseudo/ovecs.html">
      A lowdown on the equivalent of flags in Pasaru.
    </a></li>
    <li>
      <a href="Pseudo/Bigencenryin.html">Bigencenryin</a>,
      a fictional story in the constructued world of Pasaru,
      which serves as a largely alien approach to characters.
      Relatedly,
      <a href="Orsaibts/anticharacterism.html">a small rant</a>
      against the concept of characters in general.
