<p>Below is a list of languages that I maintain. It supersedes <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/post/104459911185/blurbs-for-all-the-languages">this post</a> and <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/language-list">this page</a>, both of which I shall leave up to maintain links. However, the second page has been edited to only show a link to this page.</p>
<!-- Originally there used to be only a bare-bones explanation for each one, -->
<!-- but now there is additional details for each of them -->
<!-- in the form of a few boxes that give the common details of each one. -->
<!-- Later on, there might be a few bullet points that accompany each language -->
<!-- that highlights its most distinctive features. -->
<!-- # Guide to entries # -->
<!-- Each language has a handful of short facts, -->
<!-- followed by a short summary and optionally a sample. -->
<!-- The categories are as follows: -->
<!-- Background (B) -->
<!-- : Describes what kind of place speaks the language. -->
<!-- Phonology (Φ) -->
<!-- : Choice of sounds and combinations of sounds -->
<!-- Orthography (O) -->
<!-- : Writing systems, if any -->
<!-- Grammar (G) -->
<!-- : General cover term for syntax and morphology as well as derivation -->
<!-- Pragmatics (P) -->
<!-- : The lexicon, treatments of context, and so on -->
<!-- Each feature has a completeness rating, which is a rating from 0 to five blocks: -->
<!-- [□ □ □ □ □] Planned -->
<!-- :   Nothing has been written down, at all. -->
<!-- In brainstorming phase. -->
<!-- [■ □ □ □ □] Immature -->
<!-- :   The first draft has been written, -->
<!-- or at least some framework has been adopted. -->
<!-- [■ ■ □ □ □] Developing -->
<!-- :   Things are rapidly taking shape, -->
<!-- but things can still wildly change as the language component progresses. -->
<!-- [■ ■ ■ □ □] Established -->
<!-- :   The system starts gaining quirks of its own. -->
<!-- Minor changes might still be possible, especially vocabulary -->
<!-- but for the most part things are solid. -->
<!-- [■ ■ ■ ■ □] Clean -->
<!-- :   Largely complete, the system has started to become very unique. -->
<!-- The details have been homed in, and nothing is poised to change a lot. -->
<!-- [■ ■ ■ ■ ■] Mature -->
<!-- :   The system has been given a life of its own. -->
<!-- The core of the system has stabilised and is unlikely to change further, -->
<!-- with any such change coming in the form of gaining new examples -->

<h1 id="the-four-languages-of-the-jesdic-pasaru">The Four Languages of the Jesdic Pasaru</h1>
<h2 id="egonyota-pasaru">Egonyota Pasaru</h2>
<p>The official language of the Jesdic Pasaru, <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Egonyota-Pasaru">Egonyota Pasaru</a> is the one language you must learn to truly experience life in the Empire, being the lingua franca of the Empire and its periphery, for certain definitions of “periphery”. Though its features might be uninteresting as a result, it possesses the somewhat downplayed ability to assume the form of any other language through its “pragma” system.</p>
<h2 id="serakafph-xaxex">Serakafph Xaxex</h2>
<p>The international language of the planet that bears its name, <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Serakafph-Xaxex">Serakafph Xaxex</a> is well known for its rich array of metaphor and figurative speech that compensates for its simplistic grammar that recurses poorly.</p>
<h2 id="elaga-qvaḻsa">Elaga Qvaḻsa</h2>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Yuk%C5%A9a%7Celaga-%C3%BCt%C3%A6k%7CQva%E1%B8%BBsa">Elaga Qvaḻsa</a>, once based on phonemes and other mouth-related words, has long since abandoned its spoken roots and is now entirely a “written” language encoded into numbers rather than as letters. It still retains its spoken heritage, through its intricate system of “letters” interacting with each other.</p>
<h2 id="cipogrtesaj">Cipogrtesaj</h2>
<p>A simple language for practical units, <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Cipogrtesaj">Cipogrtesaj</a> is the language for when you feel like putting all modifiers after the main sentence. It has as many vowels as it does consonants, something borne out of its highly diverse speaking population, crossing not just civilization boundaries but species boundaries.</p>
<h1 id="other-languages-in-the-jesdic-pasaru">Other languages in the Jesdic Pasaru</h1>
<p>These have grown to be so numerous that they are now divided by planet.</p>
<h2 id="pasaru-a.k.a-pseudo">Pasaru (a.k.a Pseudo)</h2>
<h3 id="yoskrail">Yoskrail</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Yoskrai">Yoskrail</a> is the programmer’s cant, a language that outwardly resembles a programming language yet contains enough concessions to make it usable for ordinary speech (and also make it become not a programming language). Spoken primarily in the isolated yet highly connected burrows of (J)erso and the surrounding ocean (now a mountain due to continental drift), it sports indenting, lexical blocks and an infinite supply of variables.</p>
<h3 id="hesmai-iok">Hesmai Iok</h3>
<p>The common language of all of the continent of Fenegil, <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Hesmai-Iok">Hesmai Iok</a> has an intense ȝender system that both nouns and verbs use, and they interact in convoluted manners. It also has a most singular lexicographical ordering that uses a length-55 vector to determine order.</p>
<h3 id="âagenzbèe">Âagenzbèe</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/%C3%82agenzb%C3%A8e">Âagenzbèe</a> is the Old Tongue of the northern lands of Pseudo. Outsiders will immediately recognize it by the language’s distinct usage of hand gestures as distinguished phonemes, a trait that it has passed on to its descendents who have changed it in many strange and wonderful ways.</p>
<h3 id="cindri">Cindri</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Cindri">Cindri</a> is a language spoken in the islands far to the north of Pseudo. It is known for its unique feature of having a knitted representation which historically is more used than the written one.</p>
<h3 id="gwa-elohba">Gwa-elohba</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/search/Gwa-elohba" title="Linking the tag doesn&#39;t work. Really, Tumblr!">Gwa-elohba</a> is the national language of Rija, and is a cousin of Cindri and a descendent of Âagenzbèe. It can be considered as a “missing link” between those two languages. Its most notable feature is that it has great dialectal variation due to its unique geopolitical situation.</p>
<h3 id="rattssaw">Rattssaw</h3>
<p>The administrative language of the Jesdic Senlis, <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Rattssaw">Rattssaw</a> is well known for its tricky application of phonemic prevocalisation (written using # for that matter), heavy use of tu-vous and strange loops in its registers.</p>
<h3 id="nnn-heeel">Nnn Heeel</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Nnn-Heeel">Nnn Heeel</a> can easily be identified by its penchant for tripled letters, but grammatically it is remarkable for having lots and lots of specialised sentences that each handle a specific and idiomatic function, such as repetition, appearance description and time progression. It has picked up multiple areal features from its neighbouring languages.</p>
<h3 id="sturp">Sturp</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Sturp">Sturp</a>, largely spoken in the technocratic country of the L.-Jerso, has no particular special feature that shines above the rest, but instead elects to have a variety of slightly special features. Such features include an awkward recursion system, hiatus to indicate proper nouns, and a semantic gender system that sometimes allows words to change class depending on its new semantic role. It may also have a special mode to communicate with Yoskrai speakers.</p>
<h3 id="drsk">Drsk</h3>
<p>Being a language that is next to or a relative of Rattssaw can seriously challenge the idea of a syllable, and this is all too clear to <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Drsk">Drsk</a>, a language that cohabits the space that Rattssaw does. A vowel-free, plosive-terminated-phonorun-based language with a limited number of nouns and Nnn Heeel style non-universal sentences, the sheer distance it has with everything else is sure to make most linguists claim that it is the language of the heavens.</p>

<p>
  (n.b. a vowel-free langauge means that a language does not have phonemic vowels.
  A language that has no <em>phonetic</em> vowels
  is a vowel-<em>less</em> language.)
</p>
<h3 id="g-j-6g-j--r">{| <sup>6G-J</sup> ~ <sub>~</sub> · <sup>6G-J</sup> -R <sub>~</sub> ||</h3>
<!-- This brace used to balance the one on the title. } -->
<p>The difficult-to-notate</p>
<pre><code>⎧⎪ 6G-J · 6J-G ⎪
⎨⎪  ~   ·  -R  ⎪
⎩⎪  ~   ·  ~   ⎪</code></pre>
<p>(displayed all on its own to show its multi-line notation) is a <a href="#" title="No link here. Tumblr does not like.">language for the deaf</a>. Instead of using intricate hand signals and motions, it uses a rod with a specific pattern of colours which users would interact with to create phonemes. The result is something of a song and dance routine, but if you don’t like that then a tabletop variant is also possible.</p>
<h3 id="eta-ges-ut">Eta-ges-ut</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Language-QD">Eta-ges-ut</a> (<a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Etagesut">alternate link</a>) is one of four that are very closely related to each other. They are described in a much more close-knit way than other languages. Each language will contain various options to a single unique idea that ensures that they can be easily reconciled into a single parent language.</p>
<p>These four languages also are a demonstration of what language types <code>mklang</code> would create.</p>
<h3 id="tim7ota">Tim7ota</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Tim7ota">Tim7ota</a> is the second of four languages above.</p>
<h3 id="caffyt">Caffyt</h3>
<p>What happens when you mix up the syntax of a spoken language and the syntax of a more formal language? The result is <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Caffyt">Caffyt</a>, a language where verbs determine how they order their nouns and the line between a sentence and a single isolated word is blurred. All with a thin veneer of English orthography and just a smidgen of broken syllables courtesy of living next to Rattssaw.</p>
<h2 id="xaxex">Xaxex</h2>
<h3 id="sekapon">Sekapon</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Sekapon">Sekapon</a> is the language of South Abeĉo. It’s well known for its multiple script system, which resembles a souped-up version of Japanese with no fewer than four scripts pulling their individual weight.</p>
<h3 id="ouduec-fxelw">Ouduec Fxelw</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Ouduec-Fxelw">Ouduec Fxelw</a> has a large phonetic inventory and is spoken in North Abeĉo. It boasts an amazingly compact script that’s alphabetic with minor logographic and syllabic aspirations, as well as a vaguely Arabic bent. The actual language is far from Arabic though, and is in fact generative from the ground up, with the language composed of several very explicit building blocks that replace one another until the meaning is expressible. This makes it easy to construct by a computer, but of course there are other obstacles to natural language processing, even with this language.</p>
<h3 id="ya-kĕnaj">Ya-kĕnaj</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/search/Ya-k%C4%95naj" title="Same problem with Gwa-elohba. It seems like hyphens are a sticking point">Ya-kĕnaj</a> is a programmer’s cant similar but not exactly the same as Yoskrail. It has the most infuriating property of basing its syntax not on a tree but on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue">double-ended queue</a>, which makes for extremely flexible yet utterly rigid syntax and the idea of a “word operator” that doesn’t say anything solid but rather operate on the deque directly.</p>
<h3 id="fs-otm">Fs Otm</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Fs-Otm">Fs Otm</a> is a fairly conventional language with a fancy, very tall script and an unconventional writing order. Like Sekapon, the language has simple onsets and complex codas, giving it a “reversed sound” feel. The inflections are a little bit nonconcatenative too, and there are rumours that in this language you <em>only</em> name actions.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<h3 id="uvbraot">Uvbraot</h3>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Uvbraot">Uvbraot</a> dials down the weirdness of almost all of its sister languages, but still contains alien concepts for English speakers such as backgrounding sentences, and half-classes.</p>
<h1 id="the-purple-languages">The Purple Languages</h1>
<p>(The Purple Languages are the languages that do not explicitly belong to the Jesdic Pasaru in any official manner. Of course, the way that the Jesdic Pasaru works, all of these languages belong to the Jesdic in some way, but not explicitly!)</p>
<p>(Oh, they’re called the Purple Languages because they are written in a purple notebook.)</p>
<h2 id="man-gog-yuu">Man gog yuu</h2>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Man-gog-yuu">Man gog yuu</a> is an Esperanto for East Asian languages, warts and all. It attempts to create a synthesis of Japanese, (the various languages of) Chinese, Korean and even Vietnamese into a primarily Classical Chinese matrix. Along the way, many, many brutal compromises were made, creating a language that sounds, looks, and even thinks differently from any of the source languages. Quite a “compromise”!</p>
<h1 id="the-cubic-languages">The Cubic Languages</h1>
<p>Cubic languages are so named because their topic symbol contains a cube. They are basically fan art, but instead of getting a pretty picture at the end you get a document.</p>
<h2 id="altrvukaif">Altrvukaif</h2>
<p><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/ABGTA">Altrvukaif</a> (no tag of its own; this one links to its parent project, “A Beginner’s Guide to Alternia”) cannot claim to be the ancestor of all i·umën languages, although contains the obvious marks of a being a language of a group of somebodies who created i·umëns and the languages that go with i·umëns. Still, i·umën speakers beware, for this language has more levels of respect and emotion sensitivity than any you might have heard of.</p>
<h2 id="atenski">Atenski</h2>
<p>A mystery project. To be publicised at a later date.</p>
<h2 id="gmòdyfäjq">g’Mòdyfäjq</h2>
<p>Ỳŋlys g’mòdyfäjt vð’Fäqdəq, commonly abbreviated to <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/g&#39;M%C3%B2dyf%C3%A4jq">g’Mòdyfäjq</a>, is a somewhat conservative alteration of English that seeks to brutally alter the phonology and especially the orthography in hopes that it will blend the names of characters and other objects in popular fiction to something at the edge of recognition. The grammar is also slightly affected, but other than a few token oddities it’s still recognisably Germanic.</p>
<h1 id="other-languages">Other languages</h1>
<p>These languages are incomplete, immature or otherwise simply old and left unfinished. They may graduate out of this list to become full languages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other languages in the Jesdic Pasaru
<ul>
<li><strong>Egonyota Bulilla</strong> and <strong>Egonyota Vohalyosun</strong> are planned ancestors of Egonyota Pasaru.</li>
<li><strong>Genbarg</strong>, a descendent of Âagenzbèe in the Esħ Pez</li>
<li><strong>Oraṕ</strong> (or Oraf), an international auxiliary language that meditates speakers of Nnn Heeel and Genbarg</li>
<li><strong>Eðam</strong>, a “secret language” spoken in the island of Ķaftenguu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other purple languages
<ul>
<li><strong>Riga Pãiberica</strong> is a hypothetical merger of Spanish and Portuguese.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>→</strong> is a tiny language fragment that only defines one verb, “becomes”, written as →. It has no means to form any part of speech and relies on other languages to donate their own. No other verbs are defined, but arrows can be chained to express continuity; furthermore there are additional helper constructs, such as brackets, to express complex concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Rðƿa</strong> is an old language that attempts to mix Chinese and English. It is currently undeveloped and will probably remain so.</li>
</ul>
