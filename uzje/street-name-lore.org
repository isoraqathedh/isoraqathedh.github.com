#+Title: Street name lore

[[./img/street-name-bonanza.png]]

This image is a spattering of street signs of various streets in Ùzje.
There is a large amount of information that is boiled into these signs,
their design, and what they represent.
We shall discuss them briefly, here.

In this image, numbers in circles represent details in sign design,
and numbers in squares represent detail regarding
the reasoning behind the names of these streets.
There's also some pretty well-hidden references in some of these signs,
which are indicated using a letter in a circle.
Clues are provided in this page,
but if you want the solution and how they are derived,
you can click on the link to the real solution.

* Road sign design.
1. Street name signs have the name of the street in g'Mòdyfäjq (above),
   Man Qog Yuu (bottom) and the house numbers that are immediately next to it.
   They also have a black pattern on the side where the road continues.
2. Where the house numbers are too long to fit in the sign comfortably,
   they can appear on a separate line.
3. If a road has no house numbers on one side,
   that can be indicated by using a dot on that side.
   Road numbers can be indicated on /top/ of the street name sign,
   with the same pattern indicating the same idea
   (that the road continues with that number in that direction).
4. A block with only one house number on that side would have no arrow.
5. Street name plates are provided even where cars are prohibited,
   such as this sign for the tram tunnel.
   As the tunnel has no house numbers on it all dots are omitted.
6. This street is from Concept City,
   which like most New World cities but entirely unlike Old World cities
   have the hundreds digit and onward indicate block numbers.
   On the left of this sign is the 0 block,
   and on the right of this sign is the 100 block.
   Additionally, this sign is also the V5, 
   as indicated by the light bulb shield on the upper left;
   and the A311, as indicated by the road number indicator on the upper-right.
   Q and V shields do not indicate which way the road continues.
7. A road can continue, but the number can change inside it.
   This sign indicates that the B114 is on the left, 
   but while the road continues on the right
   The B110 then takes over the road.
8. An example of a road that terminates with its number.
9. An example of a road that has street numbers all clustered on one side.
   This road abuts a mountain, so all buildings are on one side.
   Also note the lack of "street", "road" in this particular street name.
10. When the house numbers are placed in line with the street name,
    dots on sides of the sign with no house numbers can be omitted.
11. The Q/V roads in Boan City, where this sign is extracted from,
    use a shield similar to the A/B road numbers 
    but are placed underneath the plate instead of over it.
    Notice also that this sign has the road continue
    where the road number terminates
    (but in this case another road number picks it up,
    which is not indicated on this sign as it is on the wrong side.)
12. Signs are mounted both on the pedestrian and on the vehicle side,
    so every one of these signs have a version where the numbers are reversed.
    Naturally, this means that there are versions of signs
    where the numbers descend as well as ascend.
13. High speed roads, in particular motorways, HQDCs 
    and grade-separated interchanges,
    generally have street names that /face/ drivers rather than go alongside it.
    Because of this, the patterns that indicate that the road continues
    are irrelevant and are so omitted.
    House numbers do not appear on this type of sign.
14. An example of a road whose name continues but whose number does not.
    As the road following is unclassified,
    there is no road number sign pointing to the sign's right.
    Additionally, note that the sign is in the more compact two-line form.
15. Even the smallest of lanes are signed -- including footpaths --
    although in this case the sign is put right against a wall
    so there is no accompanying reversed version of this sign
    (except, perhaps, on the other side of the lane).
16. If a street is extended in the opposite direction with the same name
    but on the low-numbered end,
    letters are used for house numbers instead of numbers, counting up from A.
17. "End of road" signs that face the drivers are indicated using a red band.
    In this case the motorway also ends here, so it gets a band too.
18. Otherwise, if the named portion of the motorway ends but the road continues,
    the band only goes on the name, as expected.

* Lore
1. Dessert Road has a large amount of small dessert shops
   that sell traditional Chinese desserts to eat in store.
   They used to serve sailors that come past the now filled-in bay,
   but as reclamation continues they too moved north.
2. Any road called "New Road" -- as this one is --
   is guaranteed to be old, and this is no exception.
3. Located in an industrial estate, 
   Heung Mai Yee Road serves Heung Mai Yee Co.,
   which is the best-selling brand of rice in the city.
4. Most roads in Boan city has the either 寶 (Bo, treasure)
   or the letter 安 (On, stability) on it.
   This can make navigation somewhat tricky.
5. That said, Jewel Street may have 寶 in it but it is not located in Boan.
   It also doesn't have many jewellery shops in it,
   as they're all located in some significantly more upscale locations.
6. The Chinese/MQY name literally translates to "Muscles Come Street",
   so naturally there's a surfeit of private gyms around here.
   They charge you £20 a month, which doesn't sound outrageous
   until you remember that the minimum wage is only a hair over 3/- an hour!
7. Located in Szàjszyŋ, this long road carries a handful of shops
   that sell the seafood that is popular in local cuisine.
   They include salted fish, clams, fresh fish
   and even some things that don't come from the sea, strangely enough.
   However, the road continues for much longer than the market can handle,
   and strikes into the deep rural area, but never too far from the sea.
8. Bakery Street. No guesses as to what is around this particular road.
   Western and Eastern pastry are included.
   A great source of moon cakes around Mid-Autumn Festival.
9. Although now a dead-end lane sandwiched between two buildings,
   this road used to be an important surveyor's road
   as it used to be the most level road in the young colonial period.
   That's why its name in MQY was as such,
   though recent years and misspeaks have renamed the road
   into something completely unrecognisable.
10. The road from Buddhaland to Foŋjam Monastery
    gets an appropriate name referring to the 3 000 Realms,
    and is just as kitschy as it sounds.
    Road numbering rules prevent it from being called the A3000,
    which is just as well.

* References
A good deal of these names are very quietly names from imported work,
which have been mangled beyond recognition.
If you wish to recover these names, you might find these clues helpful.
They are deliberately formatted as one paragraph to prevent casual scanning,
but the letters are bolded to allow for faster more detailed scanning.
You may also wish to copy test from the raw SVG file.

*A*: Nothing to do with warring states, but lots to do as trios.
Old, green but somehow always in shade.
*B*: It's purple and high amounts of traffic that drives on it
makes drivers irritated.
*C*: Demon of Sickness.
*D*: The MQY name of this street refers to an initial noise.
*E*: With A and B, but greyer and grumpier.
*F*: Knowing some hangul could really come in handy here,
but you can also imagine a Russian sniper if you really want.
Abuts Ykskon Street.
*G*: Heung Mai Yee Rice -- a /magical/ way of making your favourite staple food.
Finds its way to King's Cross!
*H*: Recall that in g'Mòdyfäjq, the letter J is pronounced ~/j/~, as in IPA.
*I*: You can draw a line from the Moon all the way back to here,
and you'll find somewhere a long it someone in a pair of yellow track pants.
*J*: A dot makes all the difference. As does a helpful German accent.
*L*: It was originally Gyłjontar, but it was renamed in honour of a stele
that was found here. That said, naming a street something /that/ inauspicious
was never a good idea anyway, what with all the endless killing and all.
*M and N*: Both of these come from the same 10-year journey
that apparently lost the plot on its first step.
40% later, it's still limping on.
*O*: There's no disguise here other than a direct change to GMF. Sorry.
*P*: Add an -ia to the end of the GMF name, and it'll make sense.

That the characters are the reversed name of
