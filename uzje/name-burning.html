<b>Name breaking</b> or sometimes <b>name burning</b>
(syee mingr – 셔·밍, – 燒名 – c&rsquo;preqaŋ – ч&rsquo;преӄаң)
is a particular way of modifying names and identifying strings
that is prevalent in the language of g&rsquo;Mòdyfäjq,
to the point where it is in fact a part of the name of the language.

<h2 id="org44992c6"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> The idea of name breaking</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
What started as a gross misunderstanding of copyright and trademark law
eventually and somewhat inexplicably grew into this taboo
that names are considered &ldquo;copyrighted&rdquo; –
that there are some names that simply cannot be uttered
lest the &ldquo;lawyers&rdquo; get sicced on you.
In reality of course no lawyers are out to get you
if you say a name in the wrong context,
but the rest of society would happily oblige in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
For you see, some names carry an immense power.
This is the power of Trademark,
and violating the Trademark is a grave taboo.
Gaining the powers of a Trademark means that
the name is protected from improper use,
especially when referencing it in a context that it may have some relevancy in.
This, of course, includes mentioning the name
when referring to the object, which is where this &ldquo;misunderstanding&rdquo; starts.
In the end, this snowballed into the concept you see today,
where names of various things are completely
</p>

<h2 id="orga80a0f1"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Name breaking vs The Hide Taboo</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Name breaking is similar to but very distinct from the hide taboo
as seen in the Jesdic Pasaru.
Both of them involve altering names to conform to some arbitrary name standard,
but there are both similarities and differences.
Indeed, the best way to describe some qualities of both
is to compare and contrast them, and so we&rsquo;ll see how they work out.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9820448" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9820448"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> What is actually done</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
When breaking a name, the name is altered at the time of production.
This means that every time the name is pronounced or written down,
regardless of context, what comes out is the broken version of the name.
It is like a society-enforced, omnipresent word filter
with a particularly interesting set of resulting words.
</p>

<p>
Hiding a name from an object is <b>strictly</b>
altering an object in such a way that its name is no longer visible.
In its position is usually some kind of generic word,
or a plain box without description whatsoever.
In principle, the name must be originally there,
but in practise this part of the tradition is not closely followed.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd23a343" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd23a343"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> What it is done to</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Name breaking targets the name in all forms, concrete and abstract.
This basically means that every time there is a name it would have to be broken.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the hide taboo is specifically targeted towards objects,
particularly packaging material and other documents with the name of the object
prominently displayed on its surface.
It does not usually apply to the spoken word,
where the name is allowed to be emitted unhindered and unaltered.
</p>

<p>
In both cases the name of the object
is for the most part genuinely the name of an <i>inanimate</i> object;
those who are considered &ldquo;people&rdquo; or &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; or more generally
sentient beings of any sort that live in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;
aren&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t be subjected to either taboo.
Breaking or hiding a name belonging to a real person is itself a taboo,
but for different reasons:
in name breaking, you don&rsquo;t do this
because it implies that the name is protected by Trademark,
which implies ownership of the name (and therefore its owner)
by a Large Corporation, which is considered insulting;
in contrast, you don&rsquo;t do the hide taboo on &ldquo;real names&rdquo;
because, simply, alternatives have sprung up in that area
and for whatever reason those have been judged as superior to the hide taboo.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org51391d1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org51391d1"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Why it is done</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
In this respect both traditions are very similar:
one breaks or hides a name,
because one wants to obscure the object&rsquo;s relationship
with the &ldquo;real deal&rdquo;, as it were.
Even if the object has no &ldquo;real deal&rdquo;, or is entirely fictional,
they are usually actual being that could in principle be irritated
at an improper or unsanctioned use of the name.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s also very similar to other naming taboos common on Earth,
although in those traditions the elaborate phonetic alterations do not happen.
Speaking generally, and not in reference to any single existing such,
naming taboos generally affect exactly the names that these two <i>don&rsquo;t</i>:
those of living persons <i>in real life</i>, and usually those that are dead.
Nevertheless, the idea remains the same: by not saying the name &ldquo;properly&rdquo;,
one avoids attracting unwanted and potentially harmful attention
from powers whose existence remains unsubstantiated at best.
</p>

<p>
(Separately, however, there are taboos against naming the dead in both planets,
but this is not related to the topic at hand here.)

<div id="outline-container-org47ed6d2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org47ed6d2"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> How to break a name</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The best way to understand this is by example. Say you, somewhere else in the
Anglosphere, made a game about Robin Hood called &ldquo;Arrows of Justice II&rdquo; (there
was an Arrows of Justice I but it wasn&rsquo;t related to Robin Hood). Translated
literally, the name would be &ldquo;Arəw ə&rsquo;Zascistwo&rdquo;, but this is where all the name
taboos start kicking in.
</p>

<p>
You see, &ldquo;Arəw ə&rsquo;Zascistwo&rdquo; is now considered to be a &ldquo;trademarked name&rdquo; (it is
also a trademark, but that has nothing to do with it; think of it as &rsquo;sacred&rsquo; or
&rsquo;taboo&rsquo; and you&rsquo;d be about right) and because of this it is a societal
imperative not to ever refer to the game as such, not even in promotional
material! (It could sometimes, in e.g. GOTY editions of the game, appear as such
on the actual cover of the game, but even then it&rsquo;s kind of spotty). Instead,
one must break the name: turn it into a name that would make it sound like a
bootleg of itself. What it breaks into is ultimately dependent on which circle
of friends you are in, but a few examples are &ldquo;Qlowscaqtaərəqtwo&rdquo;
[law-stand-&rsquo;arrow&rsquo; II], &ldquo;7aəreaq ə&rsquo;Oàrtþər ð&rsquo;Grot two&rdquo; [&rsquo;arrow&rsquo; of the great
&rsquo;Order&rsquo; II] and &ldquo;Kzàstiəst ð&rsquo;Karovarotwo&rdquo; [&rsquo;Justice&rsquo; the &rsquo;arrow-narrow&rsquo; II]. [In
these glosses, words in &rsquo;single quotes&rsquo; have been altered internally in a way
that won&rsquo;t show up in any English back-translation.]
</p>

<p>
The same goes for the Robin Hood in the game, and this is also where the taboo
gains a practical side: the original Robin Hood, which is a historical story
with no particular author in recent history, gets it relatively light as his
name is now &ldquo;Qrobyq Qut&rdquo;, but the object in the game would get a more
elaborately broken name, which in this case might be &ldquo;Ħqropbvyq Quərdð&rdquo; or
similar. Again, the taboo on &ldquo;Ħqropbvyq Quərdð&rdquo; would also apply, and the name
would be broken again if it is to be referred to outside of the game as this new
breaking is also &rsquo;trademarked&rsquo;. Three objects, all named &ldquo;Bastion&rdquo; in English
(and so &ldquo;Bäscəq&rdquo; in the &ldquo;trademarked&rdquo; translation and using it as a common noun
meaning bulwark), can be broken in three ways to make them all distinct –
&ldquo;Baazəq&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bwasztþjaŋ&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bveəsdaq&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
If all that is a little bit over your head, an easy way to explain it is this:
imagine you&rsquo;re in a TV show of some description, and every branded object that
you see is not quite what someone on the other side of the TV screen might
see. That&rsquo;s what this &ldquo;name breaking&rdquo; business looks like.

<h3 id="orgee63f6a"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> When to mung the name</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
As previously mentioned, the important part of the name munging process
is that it must be done everywhere, all the time that the name has been emitted.
Indeed, the easiest way to figure out when to break a name
is when <i>not</i> to break a name, so we&rsquo;ll enumerate some common exceptions here.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When the object is considered &ldquo;golden&rdquo; or &ldquo;at its peak&rdquo;
or otherwise exemplary in an externally validated manner,
it is allowed for the owners of the name to produce in limited number
the actual name of the object (including non-English names)
in an &ldquo;honourary edition&rdquo; of some sort.
This honour cannot be bestowed by a committee or a government;
it is only given to by the unfocused, occasionally contradictory opinion
of society in general,
and because of this there is some manner of trepidation
in actually publishing any such edition in advance,
and this is by design.</li>
<li>Also as previously mentioned, some classes of names are never to be altered,
at least not using this mechanism.
This includes the names of all living, real life sentient objects,
as well as certain common nouns.</li>
<li>Fictional <i>non-unit</i> objects may have an exception,
the more generic the higher probability that the exception goes through.
In particular, fictional numbers and other abstract systems
almost never get their names altered,
as it is possible to consider them outside the name of the fiction they live in.</li>
<li>Non-lexemes are typically not altered.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org80efdc3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org80efdc3"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> What to mung it to and established methods</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
There is no single correct way to mung any single name;
this fact is exploited to allow for disambiguation to happen,
as we have mentioned above.
Broadly, breaking names should primarily use the techniques of
phonetic alteration, synonym substitution, or Third Language Round Trip.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Phonetic alteration</dt><dd><p>
     This is a set of rules that allow one phoneme of a word
to morph into another,
possibly with a few other ones coming together for the ride.
This basically changes the meaning of the word into something else
(usually into a meaningless sequence of phonemes)
while keeping the pronunciation similar or the same.
</p>

<p>
The mechanisms behind phonetic alteration are mystical and unpredictable,
and are best understood under the Random-Random-Random system:
a <b>random</b> number of rules are selected in a <b>random</b> order
out of a pool of available rules,
with a <b>random</b> chance of success of application of each one.
This is very different from most language change rules,
which have a fixed number of rules, all applied in the correct order.
</p></dd>
<dt>Synonym substitution</dt><dd>Whereas phonetic alteration is altering the meaning
while keeping pronunciations similar,
synonym substitution is altering the pronunciation radically
while keeping the meaning similar.
The idea is simple enough, so there&rsquo;s not much to say here;
you just change the word to a word with similar meaning,
perhaps with the same or similar phonetic alterations.</dd>
<dt>Third Language Round Trip</dt><dd><p>
     Since the alteration comes in the form of playing with language,
it&rsquo;s not surprising that other languages get thrown in for the ride.
Fortunately for g&rsquo;Mòdyfäjq, there is a convenient other language
that can be used, and that is Man Qog Yuu.
</p>

<p>
So what do you do with this language?
There are two main ways, but they are actually just the same mechanism,
just operated in opposite directions.
The most important thing to do is that in one step,
you <i>calque</i> the meaning to/from the target langauge,
and in the other, you borrow from/lend to the target language <i>phonetically</i>.
This means that there is a further obscuration of the names,
and frequently this results in none of the phonemes of the original name
surviving in any way, shape or form, which is highly aesthetic.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>
These three methods are to be used, in any combination and in any order,
any number of times.
Indeed, they tend to be more <i>types</i> of alteration
than actual mechanisms, as they do not have any concrete methods
of actually changing the name.
</p>

<p>
Of course, name breaking is an art, not a science,
and one is welcome to change or add to the three methods above.
However, keep in mind that all the other taboos are also active &#x2013;
using things like sex or violence in the process
would still be subject to the same taboos that any other context would.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
Not breaking a name, of course, has no non-social consequences.
The world will continue to spin on,
regardless of whether or not
you have created the right tiny variations in air pressure
or arranged bits of ink in the right locations.
What it does do is to lower the standing you have with your peers
because you did not follow the rules regarding names.
</p>

<p>
More specifically, when names are not broken when they are supposed to be,
readers of the unaltered name tend to get very concerned
over the prospect of having to put in a lot of care
not to accidentally insult or misuse the object that bears the unburnt name,
or to speak in hushed tones if the transgression is auditory.
</p>

<p>
More seriously, the idea of munging names is also a key point
in protecting the rights
that allow for the creation of fan-fiction and other derivative works,
which are both things that are highly valued in Ùzje society.
Without breaking the names, one is susceptible to actual, <i>real</i> lawyers
breathing down your neck for misusing actual, <i>real</i> trademarks.
An argument of tradition,
plus the fact that no two breakings end with the same result,
results in (at least for the purposes of Ùzje law)
a very tight defense for the creators of the derivative products.

Ultimately while this does not really translate (if you will) into other
languages, it is so well built into the idea of g&rsquo;Mòdyfäjq (the language that
all these funny broken names are in) that in some cases speakers tend to think
of the unbroken g&rsquo;Mòdyfäjq names as being the &ldquo;true&rdquo; names of objects and every
broken name – and so every other translated name, including the original
language that the object is named in – a reflection of the original object,
boosting linguistic pride and keeping the language alive.
