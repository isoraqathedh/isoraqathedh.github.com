the moon was in the night sky
i was above the moon and i touched it
the moon was below where i stood
it was my beloved, i must move it!


Tâvune emo ngoñat ilus
Râdodoc tâvu, laloc kâ
Tâvune ji kâ türâ sıñaroc
Kâle anu omâ alus, tıdasâ kâ!

Modern Ralian is a SVO, Erg-abs language with a fairly isolating tendency except for the screwed up verbs and some minor noun screwery. Thankfully said screwed up verbs can be reduced to a single nightmarish chart. This time, however, because i’m feeling nice, i’ll just provide the appropriate suffixes rather than the whole nightmare. Now, important for this specific passage is that unmarked verbs are in the perfective past tense unless they’re also marked as first person.
