* Grammar
A version of this grammar with the native orthography of the script 
is [[file:04a-CDN_Relay_11_Torch_Lortho_Script.pdf][available]].

** Orthography:

Lortho's writing system is written left-to-right and each vowel attaches
to the previous glyph, except for i. The orthography can be seen [[http://lortho.conlang.org/wiki/index.php?title=Orthography][here]].

** Grammar:

1. Lortho is SVO and agglutinating with some minor inflection. There are
   ten cases which are explained [[http://lortho.conlang.org/wiki/index.php?title=Morphology#Grammatical_Case][here]].
2. All nouns end in a vowel and are one of three genders: -i (masc), -u
   (fem), and -a (neut). Adjectives precede the noun and agree with
   gender only. Nouns are not pluralized when counted. Numerals also
   come before the noun and do not take any affixes if they are cardinal
   numbers modifying said noun.
3. Pluralization: Neuter and feminine nouns will add the suffix -ne
   before case suffixes. Masculine nouns will add the infix -en- before
   the final -i; if the noun ends in -ni, the infix will be -em-

   Examples:

   - Masc Singular: toshani /dragon/, Plural: toshanemi /dragons/
   - Masc Singular: khulaki /guardian/, Plural: khulakeni /guardians/
   - Fem Singular: maru /sister/, Plural: marune /sisters/
   - Neut Singular: dikha /thing/, Plural: dikhane /things/
4. Possessive pronouns are prefixes added to the noun. The prefixes are:
   | Number   | Masc    | Fem     | Neut    |
   |----------+---------+---------+---------|
   | 1S       | ni-     | nu-     | -       |
   | 2S       | lin-    | lun-    | -       |
   | 3S       | li-     | lu-     | la-     |
   | 1P       | nima-   | numa-   | -       |
   | 2P       | nani-   | nanu-   | -       |
   | 3P       | limi-   | limu-   | lima-   |
5. Adverbs end in -r and come before the word they modify; however, this
   is not a rule
6. All verbs are conjugated in gender and number and must agree with the
   subject -- implied or implicit. There are three types of verbs: -n
   verbs (the infinitive is also the stem), -o verbs (the verb stem is
   found by removing the final -o), and -t verbs (the verb stem is found
   by changing the final -t to -d).
   - The present is formed by adding the personal endings to the
     verb stem
   - The past is formed by adding the suffix -ikh to the verb stem
     before the personal endings
   - The continuous is formed by adding the suffix -ein to the verb
     stem before any other suffix
   - The passive voice is made by adding the suffix -im to the verb
     stem before any other suffix
7. Action nominals (i.e. gerunds) are formed by adding the suffix -na to
   the end of the infinitive of -o and -n verbs; the suffix -ina is
   added to the infinitive of -t verbs. Action nominals are neuter by
   default.
8. Personal endings for verbs are as follows:
   | Number | Masc  | Fem   | Neut |
   |--------+-------+-------+------|
   | 1S     | -in   | -un   | -    |
   | 2S     | -anni | -annu | -    |
   | 3S     | -i    | -u    | -a   |
   | 1P     | -inan | -unan | -    |
   | 2P     | -amin | -amun | -    |
   | 3S     | -imi  | -imu  | -ima |
