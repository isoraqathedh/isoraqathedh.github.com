'I pick up a bit, here and there.' The shopkeeper blew his nose. 'Sometimes I land on a world where they understand these things.' He turned a pair of small sad eyes on Twoflower. 'You've got a kind face, sir. I don't mind telling you.'
'Telling me what?'
'It's no life, you know, minding the Shop. Never settling down, always on the move, never closing.'
'Why don't you stop then?'
'Ah, that's it, you see, sir â€“ I can't. I'm under a curse, I am. A terrible thing.' He blew his nose again.
'Cursed to run a shop?'
'Forever, sir, forever. And never closing! For hundreds of years! There was this sorcerer, you see. I did a terrible thing.'
