'I pick up a bit, here and there.' The shopkeeper blew his nose. 'Sometimes I
land on a world where they understand these things.' He turned a pair of small
sad eyes on Twoflower. 'You've got a kind face, sir. I don't mind telling you.'

'Telling me what?'

'It's no life, you know, minding the Shop. Never settling down, always on the
move, never closing.'

'Why don't you stop then?'

'Ah, that's it, you see, sir – I can't. I'm under a curse, I am. A terrible
thing.' He blew his nose again.

'Cursed to run a shop?'

'Forever, sir, forever. And never closing! For hundreds of years! There was this
sorcerer, you see. I did a terrible thing.'

* Grammar
Arka uses an SVO word order. Adjectives come after nouns. Numerals come before
what they modify if they're cardinal and follow their antecedents if they're
ordinal. Modal adverbs directly follow the verb. Free adverbs (everything
else) can sit anywhere in the sentence, but if they're not adjacent to the
verb they modify, they take the suffix <-el> after a consonant or <-l> after
a vowel.

Verbs take the following inflections:

#+ATTR_HTML: :frame none
|             | after consonant | after vowel | copula | (neg) |
|-------------+-----------------+-------------+--------+-------|
| base        | -               | -           | et     | de    |
| past        | -at             | -t          | at     | det   |
| perfect     | -ik             | -k          | ik     | ?     |
| progressive | -or             | -r          | or     | ?     |
| continuous  | -es             | -s          | es     | ?     |

Verbs are negated using the particle <en> before it, except for <et>, which
becomes <de>.
