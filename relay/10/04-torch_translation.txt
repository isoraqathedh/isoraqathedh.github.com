"I believe that I know a great deal of things." The shopkeeper blew his nose.  "The people that come from where I do tend to know a lot."

I looked at Sufarar sadly.

"You're a friendly one." he said. "While I tell you this, pay attention."

"I will." (rote polite response to superior)

"Running this shop is difficult. I don't rest, I just buzz around like a bee. I never close the shop."

"Never close?" (indirect polite question)

"Yes, it's impossible to close the shop. The evil spirit commands me. It's a powerful curse." The shopkeeper blew his nose.

"And while you run the shop, the curse...?" (indirect polite question)

"Yes, the curse requires me to run the shop. It won't end for a hundred years! While the spirit's curse continues, I do his work."
