Grammar:

Arka uses an SVO word order. Adjectives come after nouns. Numerals come before
what they modify if they're cardinal and follow their antecedents if they're
ordinal. Modal adverbs directly follow the verb. Free adverbs (everything
else) can sit anywhere in the sentence, but if they're not adjacent to the
verb they modify, they take the suffix <-el> after a consonant or <-l> after
a vowel.

Verbs take the following inflections:

/		after consonant	after vowel	copula	(neg)
base		-		-		et	de
past		-at		-t		at	det
perfect		-ik		-k		ik	?
progressive	-or		-r		or	?
continuous	-es		-s		es	?

Verbs are negated using the particle <en> before it, except for <et>, which
becomes <de>.

Passives are either formed with <et> + verb, or verb + <yu>.
(The latter is not a true passive; it merely swaps S and O.)
