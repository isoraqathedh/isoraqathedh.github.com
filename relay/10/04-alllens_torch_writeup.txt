Grammatical tidbits:
  This lingus is SOV. Possessors come before the possessed noun, and so do (attributive) adjectives and numerals. demonstratives come after the noun.
  Most information comes in affixes.
  The head noun is only found inside the relative clause: in the main clause, there's a pronoun that replaces it. In nested relative clauses, this can get a little tricky.
  The remote past tense doubles as a narrative marker, a bit like saying "once upon a time". It's used in the first sentence of a narrative to begin it, but isn't used throughout the story.
  there are grammatical distinctions with politeness. some words are inherently more polite, and there's some affixes that increase politeness.
  when speaking to somebody older or a social superior, the polite thing to do is ask "indirect questions" instead of direct ones. In indirect questions, a statement is made and left unfinished to invite the listener to answer, instead of "demanding" them to.
  verbs in relative clauses and imperatives don't take politeness markings, belief markings, aspects, or tenses.
  the persons of the subject and object are both marked on the verb.
  the positive belief marker is used to emphasize a statement, or as a way to say "it really is!" or "i swear that this is how things are!"
  "adverbs" are placed directly before the verb root.
  according to WALS, words like "while" are called "adverbial subordinators." who knew, eh? those are suffixed on the verb.
