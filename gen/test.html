         gen-engine.js can be reused for every generator.
         test-data.js on the other hand
         is only responsible for one and only one generator,
         namely holding the data for the generator to use.
         gen-engine.js also includes functions
         relating to interfacing with the HTML.
         This should only be done after the entire page finishes loading,
         so init() is placed as far to the end of the HTML file as possible.

    <h1 id="Title">Feature generator</h1>
    <p>
      At a loss as to what new feature your language should have?
      This is a generator that can help you with your problem!
      Simply press the button and a brand new idea
      of what to put in your language will be produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a language feature which forms a component in feature theory.
      However, it is not perfect, as it is a simple text replacement engine
      and does not know anything about dependence or mutex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the generator pops up completely usual ideas,
      but other times it gives extremely bonkers ones.
      This is normal and should be expected.
